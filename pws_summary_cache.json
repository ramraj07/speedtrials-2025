    "GA3150000": "The water quality for this system has been generally satisfactory over the past several years, with a few minor violations that have been resolved.\n\nRecords show two monitoring violations in 2012 and 2018-2019 that were quickly addressed. More recently, the system had a monitoring violation in late 2020 that was also resolved. These were all relatively minor issues that did not pose any significant health risks.\n\nIn the earlier period before 2020, there were a few additional monitoring and reporting violations, but again, these were addressed promptly and did not result in any ongoing water quality problems. The system has maintained compliance with most regulations and continues to provide safe drinking water to its customers.\n\nOverall, the water quality history for this public water system indicates it is well-managed and able to consistently meet regulatory requirements. While there have been a handful of minor violations over the years, the system has demonstrated the ability to identify and correct any issues in a timely manner.",
    "GA2250005": "The water quality for this system has been generally satisfactory, with a few violations over the past several years. Records show that the system had some minor monitoring and reporting violations, primarily related to total coliform and nitrate monitoring, that were resolved through informal enforcement actions. There were also a few more significant violations, including a maximum contaminant level violation for nitrate in 2000-2001 and a treatment technique violation in 1996-1998, which were addressed through formal enforcement. Overall, the system appears to have maintained compliance with most drinking water standards, and any issues that arose were promptly addressed.",
    "GA2790005": "The water quality for this system has been generally satisfactory, with a few violations reported over the past several years.\n\nRecords show that the system has experienced a number of monitoring and reporting violations, including failures to properly monitor for contaminants and submit required reports. These violations occurred intermittently between 2008 and 2019, and were typically resolved within a few months. \n\nMore recently, the system had a treatment technique violation in 2017 due to the disinfection system not operating properly. This was addressed and resolved by the end of April 2019. Additionally, the system has had a few sporadic violations related to radionuclides, such as exceeding the maximum contaminant level for gross alpha and radium, though these have also been resolved.\n\nOverall, while the system has experienced some compliance issues in the past, the water quality appears to have been generally maintained within regulatory standards. The utility seems to be working to address any problems that arise in a timely manner.",
    "GA1990001": "The water quality for this system has been generally satisfactory, with a few violations over the past several years.\n\nRecords show that the system has had some violations related to total coliform, disinfection byproducts, and lead and copper rule requirements. These were mostly minor monitoring and reporting violations that were resolved within the required timeframes. \n\nMore recently, in 2022 and 2023, the system had a couple of Level 1 total coliform positive samples that triggered assessments. These were addressed through site visits and follow-up actions. Additionally, in 2020-2023 the system had violations related to the treatment technique requirements of the Surface Water Treatment Rule, which were also resolved.\n\nOverall, the water quality and compliance history for this system appears to be generally satisfactory, with no major long-term issues identified. The system has worked to address the violations that have occurred over the years in a timely manner.",
    "GA2330052": "The water quality for this system has been generally satisfactory, with a few violations over the past several years. Records show that the system was deactivated in 1999, but it was reactivated and has been operational since 2000.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2018, the system did not have any reported violations. However, the available data indicates that the system may have had some issues in the past, as it was deactivated in 1999. Since reactivation, the system has been serving a small population of around 25 people and has been using groundwater as its primary water source.\n\nOverall, the water quality history for this system appears to be relatively stable, with no significant issues reported in recent years. However, it's important to note that the data provided only covers a limited time period, so the long-term water quality trends may not be fully captured.",
    "GA0150003": "The water quality for this system has generally been satisfactory, with a few violations over the past several years that have been resolved.\n\nRecords show some minor violations in the 1990s and early 2000s related to total coliform bacteria and nitrate. These were addressed through informal enforcement actions and did not result in any long-term issues.\n\nMore recently, between 2011-2013, there were a number of violations related to various contaminants like lead, copper, and disinfection byproducts. These were again resolved through informal enforcement actions and operational changes. \n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the system had two Revised Total Coliform Rule violations that triggered assessments. The issues were corrected, and the system has remained in compliance since then.\n\nOverall, the data indicates this system has maintained generally good water quality, with any issues that have arisen being promptly addressed. The utility appears to be actively managing the system to keep it in compliance."
